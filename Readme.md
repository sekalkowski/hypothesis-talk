## About

This code repository contains the live examples as shown in the related Talk from
[Meetup #6](https://www.meetup.com/saarpython/events/287878245/) of the
[SaarPython User Group](https://www.meetup.com/saarpython/).

### Original Outline

Sebastian Kalkowski
Testing with Hypothesis - How to make your code more robust and maintainable with automated fuzzing.

Having to deal with bugs in production is no fun, and often enough they are caused by exotic edge cases that we as
programmers could have never thought of. (How do users even come up with these real-world inputs all the time?)
This talk will explore:
- What property based unit-testing is
- Why it is useful for battle-testing your code
- And how the Python library Hypothesis can take coming up with and enumerating exotic edge-cases off your shoulders
